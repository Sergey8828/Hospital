# Project_Hospital
This project was created in a C# language of Visual studio .NET platform. The application allows hospital staff to perform such operations as checking capacity of wards, adding patients, deleting patients, viewing patient information, and managing appointments. In this application, I had a Patient class with properties for name, age, gender, and blood type. We also had several wards for patients with different capacity. Information about wards and patients can be saved into and retrieved from the JSON file. I used GUI and XAML technologies to create friendly interface during this project.
Technologies Used: Backend: C#, Frontend: XAML, JSON
